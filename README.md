# Top 3 Video Players for Flutter App

Flutter's official team provides a package video_player (https://pub.dev/packages/video_player) to play videos on a flutter app. But this package does not have many features and needs a lot of customisation to build a video player that can be actually used for any practical purpose. So, some other packages have been build on top of video_player package to provide its advanced versions that can be used for our use cases.

Based on the popularity, scores and likes on pub.dev, following are the top 3 video players for flutter :

1. Chewie - https://pub.dev/packages/chewie
2. Better Player - https://pub.dev/packages/better_player
3. Flick Player - https://pub.dev/packages/flick_video_player

All these players have been demonstrated in the project
